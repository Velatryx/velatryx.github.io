Hello. I am Murad Isgandarli, a 19 year old Business Administration student from Baku, who is transitioning his career to Cybersecurity (OffSec). I created this website to share and grow with people like me. I have a few hobbies, like kickboxing, playing volleyball, swimming, gaming, chess, doing CTFs and enjoying the moment! 

My Ethical Hacking journay just began, yet I feel I already learned so many things. I will keep updating this section as I continue growing in this field. 

P.S.: This website was created using a template :P
